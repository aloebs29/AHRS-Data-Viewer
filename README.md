# AHRS Data Viewer

This is a simple data viewer for tests performed with 9-DOF motion detectors in real-time. The 0'th column is expected to be the time column, 1-3 for accelerometer x/y/z, 4-6 for gyroscope x/y/z, and 7-9 for magnetometer x/y/z. The viewer allows you to plot one data type (i.e. accelerometer, gyro, or magnetometer) at one time for any number of data sets, and splits the x, y, and z axes on to seperate plots.
